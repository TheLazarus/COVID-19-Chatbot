      discovered coronavirus.

      in humans including common cold and more severe forms like SARS and MERS which

  utter_query_corona_symptoms:
  - text: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness.Some
      patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or diarrhea.These
      symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
  utter_query_corona_spread:
  - text: People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads
      primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth,
      which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs or sneezes.
  utter_query_corona_spread_person:
  - text: COVID-19 is mainly spread through respiratory droplets expelled by someone
      who is coughing or has other symptoms such as fever or tiredness. Many people
      with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms.
  utter_query_corona_spread_person_sexually:
  - text: Based on current evidence, coronavirus – the virus that causes COVID-19
      illness – is not present in the sexual fluids of someone with the virus
  utter_query_corona_isolation:
  - text: Self-isolation is an important measure taken by those who have COVID-19
      symptoms to avoid infecting others in the community, including family members.
  - text: Self-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other
      COVID-19 symptoms stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places.
  utter_query_corona_protection:
  - text: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub
      or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water
      or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
  - text: Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others.
      Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets
      from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.
  - text: Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds,
      you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COIVD-19
      and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet).
  - text: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and
      can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your
      eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.
  - text: Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.
      This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when
      you cough or sneeze.
  - text: Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache,
      mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need
      to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others.

      but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your
      local health authority.

      the best way to protect others and yourself.

      and others. This is especially important if you are standing by someone who
      is coughing or sneezing.
  utter_query_corona_protection_methods_contact:
  - text: If you become ill, even with very mild symptoms you must self-isolate
  - text: Even if you don’t think you have been exposed to COVID-19 but develop symptoms,
      then self-isolate and monitor yourself
  - text: You are more likely to infect others in the early stages of the disease
      when you just have mild symptoms, therefore early self-isolation is very important.
  - text: If you do not have symptoms, but have been exposed to an infected person,
      self-quarantine for 14 days.

      as possible at a nearby testing station.

      infected as any other age group and can spread the disease.Evidence to date
      suggests that children and young adults are less likely to get it.
  - text: Old people are more more vulnerable to this infection, so they should take
      more strict measures.

      against COVID-19.
